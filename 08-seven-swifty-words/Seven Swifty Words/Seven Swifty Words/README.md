#  Seven Swifty Words

Adaptation of the game _Seven Little Words_.


## Description

From the [official website](http://www.7littlewords.com/):

> In each puzzle, use the clues to help you click on the 20 tiles in the right order to unscramble the 7 hidden words.

More specifically, in our version:

-  Players are asked to spell seven words out of various letter groups.
    - It's important that the number of letter groups adds up to 20. That's how many buttons we'll have
    -  Each word comes with a clue for the player to guess. 

-  Each clue can be spelled by tapping the letters in the buttons. 

-  When a user has spelled the word they want, they click Submit to try it out. 
    -  If the answer is correct, they'll see it in the Answers label. 
    -  Otherwise, that answers label just shows the number of letters in the correct answer.
