# Imitation Apple Notes

📝 Note: This challenge was written in the era of iOS before iOS 9. Apple Notes has gotten dramatically richer since then &mdash; wonderfully so &mdash; but here, we're mainly trying to capture the core note-taking functionality.

## 🥅 Challenge

Create an imitation of the Apple Notes app using the skills covered so far in the book (and any others 🙂).

> How much of the app you imitate is down to you, but I suggest you work through this list:
>   1. Create a table view controller that lists notes. Place it inside a
>      navigation controller. (Project 1)
>
>   2. Tapping on a note should slide in a detail view controller that contains
>      a full-screen text view. (Project 16)
>
>   3. Notes should be loaded and saved using NSCoding. You can use
>      UserDefaults if you want, or write to a file. (Project 12)
>
>   4. Add some toolbar items to the detail view controller – “delete”
>      and “compose” seem like good choices. (Project 4)
>
>   5. Add an action button to the navigation bar in the detail
>      view controller that shares the text using UIActivityViewController. (Project 3)
>
>  Once you’ve done those, try using Interface Builder to customize the UI – how close can you
>  make it look like Notes?
>
>  Note: the official Apple Notes app supports rich text input and
>  media. Don’t worry about that; focus on plain text.
