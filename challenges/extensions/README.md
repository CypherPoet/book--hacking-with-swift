# Extensions Challenge

From the Handbook:

> 1. Extend the Integer protocol with an isEven() method that returns true if a number is even
>    and false if itâ€™s odd.
>
> 2. Extend String with a length property that returns the number of characters it has.
>
> 3. Extend UIView so that it has a bounceOut(duration:) method that uses animation to scale
>    its size down to 0.0001 over a specified number of seconds.
>
> 4. Extend Array so that it has a mutating remove(item:) method. Tip: you will need to add
>  the Comparable constraint to make this work!
