# Private Photos App

## Challenge

> Your final challenge is to create a private photos app – think _Mission Impossible_, or at least as
> close as you can get to it in a programming tutorial!
>
> The Notes app for iOS has the ability to lock certain notes so that Touch ID
> must be used to reveal the note, and your mission is to
> create something similar for a photo library.
>
> At its most basic, you’re going to want to start your app with something like project 10: a
> collection view, plus the ability to load images. In the wrap up for that chapter, I mentioned
> using picker.sourceType = .camera, and here’s your chance to use it so that users can take
> photos straight to their private library.
>
> Once you have the collection view working, go to project 12 to add support for NSCoding so
> that you can write data to disk.
>
> Finally, jump to project 28 to add support for Touch ID. If you wanted to be really fancy, you
> could prompt the user for a fallback password for times when Touch ID wasn’t working –
> using a UIAlertController similar to project 5 ought to do the trick.
>
> For bonus points: make the app show a fake set of innocuous images when it runs, only
> loading the private images when the user authenticates.
